# LEGO SPIKE Prime with Python Lessons

This page gives coaches, mentors, and students a quick overview of how to use the LEGO SPIKE Prime with Python lessons in this repository.

---

## Who This Is For

- FIRST LEGO League teams using a SPIKE Prime hub with **Python (SPIKE 3)**.
- Coaches who want a clear path from **basic Python** to **competition‑ready missions**.
- Students who prefer text‑based coding instead of blocks.

---

## Lesson Phases

The lessons are grouped into phases:

1. **Phase 1 – Python Basics (Online IDE)**  
   Use the browser playground at <https://www.onlineide.pro/playground/python> to learn:
   - Variables, types, and expressions.
   - `if`/`elif`/`else` and loops.
   - Functions, lists, and dictionaries.

2. **Phase 2 – Spike Hardware & Runtime**  
   Move into the **SPIKE App IDE** and learn:
   - Hub, ports, motors, and sensors.
   - Encoders and the motion sensor.
   - `async`/`await` and `runloop`.

3. **Phase 3 – Robot Helpers & Missions**  
   Connect the lessons directly to `master.py`:
   - Straight driving, pivots, and spin turns.
   - Attachments and async helpers.
   - `MotorIsStopped`, `mission_selector`, and `mission_0`–`mission_9`.

4. **Challenges – Apply What You’ve Learned**  
   Use the challenge pages to:
   - Tune drives and turns on the FLL mat.
   - Practice attachments and combined motion.
   - Build and optimize full missions, including the Guided Mission 2025–26.

## How To Use These Lessons

1. Start at the **Lessons Index**: `index.html`  
   - Follow lessons 1–4 in the online IDE.  
   - Then switch to SPIKE for lessons 5 and beyond.
2. Read the matching **per‑helper lessons** (DF/DB/PLO/PLI/etc.) when you introduce each function in `master.py`.
3. After each phase, assign one or more **Challenges** from `challenges-index.html`.
